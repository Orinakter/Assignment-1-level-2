### 1.What are some differences between interfaces and types in TypeScript?
In TypeScript, interfaces are used to describe the shape of an object, defining what properties and methods it should have. Types, on the other hand, can describe not just objects but also unions, intersections, primitives, and other complex types. One key difference is that interfaces can be extended using the extends keyword and support declaration merging, which means if you declare the same interface more than once, TypeScript will combine them. Types cannot be merged â€” if you declare the same type name twice, it will cause an error. Interfaces are often preferred when designing class structures or public APIs, while types are more useful when you need to combine multiple types or work with advanced type features. Even though both can sometimes be used for similar purposes, the choice usually depends on whether you are working mainly with object shapes (interfaces) or more complex type operations (types).

### 2.How does TypeScript help in improving code quality and project maintainability?
TypeScript helps improve code quality and project maintainability by adding static type checking, which allows developers to catch errors early during development instead of at runtime. It makes the code more predictable and easier to understand because you can clearly see what types of data are expected and returned. TypeScript also improves IDE support, giving features like autocompletion, navigation, and refactoring tools, which speed up development and reduce mistakes. With its strict typing and better tooling, TypeScript makes it easier for teams to work together, update code safely, and maintain large projects over time.
